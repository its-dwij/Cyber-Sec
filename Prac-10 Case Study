The Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act) was enacted in India to develop a legal framework for electronic governance and to address issues relating to cybercrime and privacy. With the proliferation of the internet and digital transactions, the IT Act has evolved to incorporate various aspects of technology law, including digital signatures, cybercrime, and privacy concerns. This case study examines the key provisions of the IT Act, its impact on IT governance in India, and notable cases that have emerged under this legislation.

Digital Signatures (Section 3): The IT Act recognizes digital signatures as valid and legally binding. It provides a framework for the use of digital signatures, making electronic transactions more secure.
E-Governance (Section 4): The act facilitates the use of electronic records and digital signatures in government and legal systems, aiming to simplify bureaucratic processes and improve efficiency.
Cybercrime (Sections 66-74): The IT Act defines various cybercrimes, including hacking (Section 66), identity theft (Section 66C), and data theft (Section 43). Penalties for these offenses range from fines to imprisonment.
Intermediary Liability (Section 79): The act establishes the liability of intermediaries, which include internet service providers and social media platforms, providing a safe harbor if they act in good faith.
