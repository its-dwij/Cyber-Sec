The five phases of ethical hacking are:

Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Scanning: Actively probing the target for open ports and services using tools to gather more detailed information.
Gaining Access: Exploiting identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system.
Maintaining Access: Establishing a backdoor or other methods to maintain access to the system for future exploitation.
Clearing Tracks: Erasing evidence of the hacking activity to avoid detection and leave the system in its original state.
