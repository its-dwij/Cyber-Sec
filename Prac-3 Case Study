Here are some basic concepts of malware:

Definition: Malware, or malicious software, is designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computer systems and networks.

Types
Virus: Attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when the host file is executed.
Worm: Self-replicating and spreads across networks without needing a host file.
Trojan: Disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.
Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption keys.
Spyware: Collects user information without their knowledge.
Adware: Displays unwanted ads, often bundled with free software.
Infection Vector: Common ways malware spreads include email attachments, downloads, infected websites, and removable media.

Purpose: Malware can steal data, disrupt services, gain unauthorized access, or create botnets for coordinated attacks.

Detection and Removal: Antivirus software, firewalls, and regular system updates are essential for protecting against malware.

Prevention: Safe browsing habits, avoiding suspicious downloads, and keeping software updated can reduce malware risks.
